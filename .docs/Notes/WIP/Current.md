Current Work
============

Major Projects
==============

Identity Issues
---------------
- [ ] Redesign to not have to use 2 different web clients (ideally)
- [X] Find another way to store credentials that can be shared by a mechanism for getting the bot's identity if using bot creds.
- [ ] Perhaps a functional capabilities system should exist?

Logging and Configuration in Infra Lib
--------------------------------------

- [ ] Standardize on Generators

Serialization Tests
-------------------

- [ ] All Serializable types need tests

Client Lib
----------

- [ ] Implement Management Tracking and Session Lifecycle for Groups, Servers, and Consoles.

Composition Issues
------------------

- [ ] Not sure the composition system for Infra should be exposed the way it is.  Each root type should have its own builders.

- [ ] Make the factories all private and use builders?
