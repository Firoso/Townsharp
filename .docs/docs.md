Townsharp Repository Documentation
==================================

Overview
--------

This is **NOT** the official documentation for Townsharp.  That documentation will be in the github wiki for the project.  
Rather this is the documentation for the repository that has a lifecycle linked to change process of commits to TownSharp.

This repository includes notes on Alta's API contracts, on Townsharp's development for internal use, 
and on SDK engineering for contributors wanting to improve Townsharp.

The official documentation for Townsharp will be hosted on the [Townsharp Documentation Site](https://github.com/PolyphonyRequiem/Townsharp/wiki).

--------------

[Global Subscriptions docs](/AltaContracts/Subscriptions/Subscriptions.md) contain the contracts and implementation details for the global subscriptions service.

Identity documentation and WebAPI documentation are not yet available.
